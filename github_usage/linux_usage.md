## CLI
Bash: Bourne-again shell  
command-line interface  
1. send typed commmands  
2. display text output  

Command and arguments  
- command : action we use  
- options: how to operate  
- arguments: what things to operate  


In your terminal, it's **username** and **hostname** like this: `endrol@endrol-laptop:~$ `, `endrol` is the username while `endrol-laptop` is the hostname (computer name).     `~` is the current directory, now is **home** folder.  

shortcut
There are some shortcuts that can help you with CLI. 
- Tab: completion
- Text navigation
    - ctrl-A: move to the begining line
    - ctrl-E: move to the end of line
    - ctrl- left, right: move one word at a time
    - ctrl-U: remove command to the begining place
    - ctrl-K: remove the later part of cursor
    - ctrl-R: search history to match

**man** command to help  
``man ls``, gives `ls` command details.

apropos Find command  
``apropos "list"``, show what command can list stuffs. 

## Files and Folders
- file : gives file type, directory or ascii file
- stat : display ownership, modification infos.

In folders, use `\ ` to use space inside a folder name.  
- cd: navigation. 
    - `cd -` : go back to the previous path. Alter the path of two current paths. 

- ls -l / ls -lh : long list with details
- cp a.txt b.txt: copy one file to another file or place.
- mv : move file or rename files.

- find : locate files 

- chmod: change file permissions  
u: user, g: group, o: others  
r: read, w: write, x: execute  
+: add permission, -: remove permission, =: give permissions only what's specified
    - ``chmod u+rwx``: add read, write, execute permission for user. 
    - ``sudo chown root test.sh``: change onership to root  


links, a file that acts as a reference to anotehr file  
Hard links, points data on the disk. Soft link(symbolic link) points a file on the disk. 

- ``ln -s a.txt b.txt`` : soft link
- ``ln a.txt b.txt`` : hard link, (not use for now)


### File system
- / : root, highest level of filesystem hierarchy
- home : stores user's home folders
- root : stores root's home folder
- etc : configuration files for many tools


## Common command-line tools
Unix philosophy: Programs should do one thing and do it well. Many modules tools rather than one big tool. **Modularity and Flexibility**

### pipes | 
- ``echo "hello" | wc`` ï¼š wc what echo gives

### tools for text
- cat: read filesls
- head, tail : some specified part of text
    - ``cat poems.txt | head -n10`` : read file, then give first 10 lines
- less : read text files like `man`

### searching for text
- grep : find desired text in a file. **Regular expression**
    - ``grep -in "the" poems.txt`` : match "the" in poems.txt file. 

### manipulating text
- awk: structred text and output it.
    - ``awk '{print $2 "\t" $1}' simple_data.txt | sort -n``

- sed: changing data
    - ``sed "s/Orange/Red/" simple_data.txt`` : change Orange to Red in text

- sort: sort the data
    - ``sort -k2 -n simple_data.txt`` : sort text file by key2 as numric order


### VIM
- insert mode: i, `shift + i` last place of file
- command mode: esc. `:w` write, `:wq` write and quit. `:q!` exit without save. 
    - `shift + g` : go to last position of file
    - `1 + shift+ g` : go to the first place opf file
    - `(, )` : go previous sentence or next sentence
    - `{, }` : go through paragraph

### Nano

### working with archives
- tar file: compression files
    - `tar caf myfiels.tar.gz Exercise\ Files/` tar files. 
    - `tar xf myfiles.tar.gz -C unpack_directory` : untar files in some place

- zip : zip and unzip
    - `zip -r file.zip hello/` : recursively zip files inside a folder
    - 'unzip file.zip' : unzip this ziped files

### Redirection
- stdin 0, stdout 1, stderr 2
    - `ls 1>filelist.txt` : save the output of ls into a txt file
    - `echo "append text >>filelist.txt"` : add some appending text into the file


### enviroment and path
- `which ls` : where the command program is
- env: check path
- add path variable:
    - `cd ~ | nano .profile` and add `PATH="$PATH:/path/to/mytools"` : add new tools in PATH


## some Advenced tpoics
- `ls -lah /etc/*release` : system check

- `free -h`

- `df -h`
